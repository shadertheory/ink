// for defining build steps and express dependencies between them, allowing the
// build runner to parallelize the build automatically (and the cache system to
// know when a step doesn't need to be re-run).

    // This creates a module, which represents a collection of source files alongside
    // some compilation options, such as optimization mode and linked system libraries.
    // Zig modules are the preferred way of making Zig code available to consumers.
    // addModule defines a module that we intend to make available for importing
    // to our consumers. We must give it a name because a Zig package can expose
    // multiple modules and consumers will need to be able to specify which
    // module they want to access.
    const root = b.addModule("ink", .{
        // The root source file is the "entry point" of this module. Users of
        // this module will only be able to access public declarations contained
        // in this file, which means that if you have declarations that you
        // intend to expose to consumers that were defined in other files part
        // of this module, you will have to make sure to re-export them from
        // the root file.

    // Here we define an executable. An executable needs to have a root module
    // which needs to expose a `main` function. While we could add a main function
    // to the module defined above, it's sometimes preferable to split business
    // logic and the CLI into two separate modules.
    //
    // If your goal is to create a Zig library for others to use, consider if
    // it might benefit from also exposing a CLI tool. A parser library for a
    // data serialization format could also bundle a CLI syntax checker, for example.
    //
    // If instead your goal is to create an executable, consider if users might
    // be interested in also being able to embed the core functionality of your
    // program in their own executable in order to avoid the overhead involved in
    // subprocessing your CLI tool.
    //
    // If neither case applies to you, feel free to delete the declaration you
    // don't need and to put everything under a single module.
